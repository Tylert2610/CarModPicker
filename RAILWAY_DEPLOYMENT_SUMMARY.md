# Railway Deployment Changes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to prepare both the frontend and backend for Railway deployment while maintaining compatibility with existing Kubernetes configurations.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Database Configuration (`Backend/app/core/config.py`)

- Added Railway DATABASE_URL environment variable handling
- Added `@validator` to automatically use Railway's `DATABASE_URL` when available
- Added Railway-specific environment variables (`PORT`, `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT`)
- Enhanced CORS settings to include common development ports

#### 2. Automatic Migrations (`Backend/app/main.py`)

- Added automatic database migrations on startup
- `run_migrations()` function runs `alembic upgrade head` when:
  - `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT` is set, OR
  - `DATABASE_URL` is set (Railway provides this)
- Added CORS middleware configuration
- Graceful error handling - app continues to start even if migrations fail

#### 3. Docker Configuration (`Backend/Dockerfile`)

- Updated CMD to use Railway's dynamic `PORT` environment variable
- Maintains backward compatibility with default port 8000

#### 4. Environment Variables (`Backend/env.example`)

- Created example environment file with Railway-specific documentation
- Includes all required variables with descriptions
- Clear instructions for Railway deployment

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. API Configuration (`Frontend/src/services/Api.ts`)

- Enhanced API base URL logic for production deployments
- Development: Uses Vite proxy (`/api`)
- Production: Uses `VITE_API_URL` environment variable if set
- Fallback: Uses `/api` for same-domain deployments

#### 2. Docker Configuration (`Frontend/Dockerfile`)

- Added build argument support for `VITE_API_URL`
- Allows Railway to inject backend URL during build

#### 3. Environment Variables (`Frontend/env.example`)

- Created example environment file for frontend
- Instructions for Railway deployment configuration

### Documentation

#### 1. Backend Deployment Guide (`Backend/RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`)

- Step-by-step Railway deployment instructions
- Environment variable configuration guide
- Troubleshooting section
- Production considerations

#### 2. Frontend Deployment Guide (`Frontend/RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`)

- Frontend-specific Railway deployment steps
- API URL configuration details
- Custom domain setup instructions

## Railway Deployment Process

### Backend Deployment

1. Create Railway project from GitHub repo
2. Add PostgreSQL database service
3. Configure environment variables:
   - `SECRET_KEY`
   - `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
   - `EMAIL_FROM`
   - `SENDGRID_VERIFY_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_ID`
   - `SENDGRID_RESET_PASSWORD_TEMPLATE_ID`
   - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (include frontend domain)
4. Deploy - migrations run automatically

### Frontend Deployment

1. Deploy backend first and get its URL
2. Create new Railway service for frontend
3. Set `VITE_API_URL` to backend URL
4. Deploy

## Compatibility Notes

### Kubernetes Compatibility

- All existing Kubernetes configurations remain unchanged
- New environment variables are optional and don't affect K8s deployments
- Docker images work in both Railway and Kubernetes environments

### Development Compatibility

- Local development continues to work as before
- No changes to existing `.env` files required
- Vite dev server proxy continues to work for local development

## Key Benefits

1. **Zero-Config Database**: Railway's PostgreSQL addon works automatically
2. **Automatic Migrations**: No manual migration steps required
3. **Flexible Configuration**: Works with both Railway and custom deployments
4. **Development Friendly**: No changes to local development workflow
5. **K8s Compatible**: Existing Kubernetes configs continue to work

## Environment Variables Reference

### Backend Required

- `SECRET_KEY`: JWT secret key
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: Email service API key
- `EMAIL_FROM`: Sender email address
- Template IDs for email verification and password reset

### Backend Optional (Railway sets automatically)

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `PORT`: Application port
- `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT`: Environment indicator

### Frontend Required for Production

- `VITE_API_URL`: Backend URL for API calls

## Testing

Both configurations have been tested:

- Backend configuration imports successfully
- Frontend builds without errors
- No linting errors introduced
- Existing functionality preserved
